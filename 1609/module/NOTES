Begun integrating the af_wsmp module into kernel version 4.8-rc2. Changes reflect data structure changes from 3.19-4.8, and configuration files. Work still needs to be done to add a wsmp_sendmsg function and finish linking in socket.h and others. Once linking is complete, unit testing of each kernel function needs to be done (particularly in the case of what seems to be a segfault condition in a typecasting function).
